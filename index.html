			<p>Mistakenly thought of as rodents, Rabbits--that popular household pet and woodland creature--are actually of the order Lagomorpha, not Rodentia. If this re-classification in any way changes your mind about rabbits and you see yourself contemplating owning one (or even just want to learn more about them), below you'll find some information about rabbits that might help. <br><font size="2">Thanks to the ever-reliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit">Wikipedia</a> for the above info.</font></p>

			<p>Some of the above may be confusing to you; here are some definitions:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Flyback:</strong> This fur is distinguished by its <em>rapid</em> repositioning when the folice is moved against the grain (i.e., when rubbed from tail towards head).</li>
				<li><strong>Rollback:</strong> Distinguished by its slower return to position when follicle is stroked against the grain.</li>
				<li><strong>Guard hairs:</strong> The outer coat that is (usually) composed of wider and longer follicles.</li>
				<li><strong>Rex fur:</strong> Composed of shorter, denser hair follicles than those of average rabbit fur. Guard hairs are the same length as the undercoat, creating incredibly soft, plush fur.</li>
			</ul></p>
